/**
 * Why make Easy_ref_t RAII-less?
 *
 * It would simplify design of Easy_ref_t, since it doesn't need to
 * implement RAII-part logic.
 *
 * It would also make it easier to use member function of Easy_ref_t in Multi_t,
 * provided that libcurl callback provides CURL* and that option CURLOPT_PRIVATE 
 * which enables storing any object, isn't support until 7.10.3.
 *
 * PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS
 *     Persistent connections means that libcurl can re-use the same connection for several transfers, 
 *     if the conditions are right.
 * 
 *     libcurl  will  always  attempt  to use persistent connections. 
 *     Whenever you use curl_easy_perform or curl_multi_perform/curl_multi_socket_action etc, 
 *     libcurl will attempt to use an existing connection to do the transfer, and if none exists it'll
 *     open a new one that will be subject for re-use on a possible following call curl_easy_perform or 
 *     curl_multi_perform/curl_multi_socket_action.
 * 
 *     To allow libcurl to take full advantage of persistent connections, you should do 
 *     as many of your file transfers as possible using the same handle.
 * 
 *     If you use the easy interface, and you call curl_easy_cleanup(3), all the possibly 
 *     open connections held by libcurl will be closed and forgotten.
 * 
 *     When you've created a multi handle and are using the multi interface, the connection pool is 
 *     instead kept in the multi handle so closing and creating new easy handles to do transfers 
 *     will not affect them. 
 *     Instead all added easy handles can take advantage of the single shared pool.
